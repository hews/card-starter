## Court Images

Graphics on face cards are rendered using Chris Aguilar's [vectorized-playing-cards](http://code.google.com/p/vectorized-playing-cards/) SVG files. As I understand it, his work is hand-vectorized version of standard [Anglo-American court cards](http://www.madore.org/~david/misc/cards.html) which are in public domain except for back and Joker images which vary and are mostly still copyrighted and thus absent from Chris' work.

## Card Back Image

Image in `assets/gray-scott.psd` is from Michal Migursky's article
[generating repeating patterns](http://mike.teczno.com/notes/gray-scott-reaction-diffusion.html)
which is an example of Gray-Scott model of reaction-diffsion. Python source code used to generate
the pattern can be found in the article.
