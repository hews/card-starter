# Intro

This project is a heavily modified version of [Zack Waugh's Helveticards](/zachwaugh/Helveticards) with following notable differences:

1. Cards are scalable.
2. Card size may be specific to individual cards or set of cards.
3. Face cards have standard Anglo-American court images rendered from Chris Aguilar's [vectorized-playing-cards](http://code.google.com/p/vectorized-playing-cards/) SVG files.
4. Uses custom font for suit symbols to provide visual consistency.
5. Cards can be flipped to show the back-side.

*At least for now, this is not a fire-and-forget project to me so please do suggest features and file issues.*

# Compatibility

Supported browsers are:

* Recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari
* IE9
* iOS and Android browsers [1]

[1] Renders and resizes just fine but dat-gui gets quirky to use.
