/*
 * Playing Card Data and Methods
 * 
 * Make sure you have loaded the utility library Lodash in order to use this.
 * 
 * - https://lodash.com (documentation)
 * - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/3.10.0/lodash.js
 * 
 * This library adds two global variables and five global functions:
 * 
 * (variable) deckOfCards:    a single deck that represents the working deck
 * (variable) deckIsShuffled: a bool describing if the deck is shuffled or 
 *                            sorted
 *
 * (function) shuffle:          shuffle (or re-shuffle) the current deckOfCards
 * (function) sort:             sort the current deckOfCards
 * (function) pickRandom:       pick a random card from the deckOfCards - only 
 *                              useful when the deck is sorted, since you can 
 *                              just pop off of the top of a shuffled deck!
 * (function) dealDeck:         returns a full deck of cards, sorted
 * (function) resetDeckOfCards: resets the deckOfCards to a full deck, sorted
 *
